# Predicting-Air-pollution-dhaka
This code creates predicts Air Pollution(particulate matter) using meteorological data (Dhaka)
●	Meteorological datasets of 5 years are utilized to train ml models and predict the concentration of pollutants 
●	Temporal and spatial analysis is done to find  the variance of concentrations 
●	Analysis is done to find the percentage that exceeds the standard values
●	Performance of ml models is compared and the best ml model for the data relevant with Dhaka is found
